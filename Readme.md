# Upload to Cloudinary

This sample project, helps you to understand how to upload images to cloudinary in Python. It is the same as in the 
CodeMentor article [here](https://www.codementor.io/chidioguejiofor/draft/vj2n7j2kb)


### Setup 

To setup the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/chidioguejiofor/upload-image-to-cloudinary.git`
2. Create a .env file in the project directory
3. Input your Cloudinary app information using the .env-sample as guide
4. Install pipenv by running `pip install pipenv`
5. Install all the dependencies of the project by running `pipenv install`


Once this is done, you would be a able to run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server and hit the endpoint 
using  postman. See [this section of the tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/chidioguejiofor/draft/vj2n7j2kb#test-app-using-postman) 
for more info.
